# Cross-Validated  
Cross-validation is a model validation technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.    
  
In this project, we had gathered knowledge of various statistical tools like sampling methods, Regression, Bayesian Analysis, Numerical Optimization Methods, etc.  

#### Basic Probability theory and random variable-
We started with learning basic probability concepts like random experiments, mutually exclusive events, joint probability, marginal probability, conditional probability, independent events, probability functions, variance, and expectation. And then moved on to discrete probability distribution like binomial, Poisson, geometric Continuous distributions like uniform and normal distributions, jointly Distributed random variables, covariance, and correlation.    
  
#### Estimation and Hypothesis testing-  
A test statistic from a hypothesis test measures how many standard errors the observed point estimate is away from the expected null hypothesis value. If the observed value is too many standard errors from the expected value, we don't believe the null hypothesis or there is evidence against it (falsification).  
  
#### Numerical Optimization Methods-  
Explored Newton Raphsonâ€™s method, Gradient Ascent, and Stochastic Gradient Descent  
  
#### Sampling Methods -   
We were introduced to various sampling methods  
  
#### Bayesian Analysis-  
Gained the knowledge of introductory Bayesian Analysis.   
  
#### Regression & Maximum Likelihood Estimation -  
Learned about types of regression and applied them to find Maximum Likelihood Estimator(MLE).  
   
In the end, we had applied our statistical knowledge to do two mini-projects one based on the real-life dataset(Ranking of Bollywood movies on the basis of Bayesian average) and other on the titanic dataset(Calculating probability of Survival of Jack & Rose).
